<p>Bilkent University Mayfest concerts have always picked the interest of ticket scalpers, but this year, this caused many people not being able to go to MFO concert. Many people just want to have some fun with their friends without paying a significant amount of money out of their pockets. What scalpers do has no benefit to anyone but them.</p>

<p>What scalpers do is, indeed, illegal; considering they did actively resale a non-profit, tax-exempt item, which they have no right to make profit over. What the school should have done was pairing each ticket with Student IDs, and actually checking if the ID holder (and the +1) is the legitimate person at the gates. Defending scalpers with the assumption "maybe they won't make it, that's why they're selling it" is outright idiotic, as all of these people sell their tix many times more than 30 TL.</p>

<p>Truth is, I just want people to know the buzzkills who prevented them having fun. I don't care if you are offended by this webpage. You shared your post on a Facebook group, remember. Think about it this way, there is no such thing as bad publicity, amirite?</p>
